# Project 1 Proposal Review Status

As of **Noon 2021-03-04**: 

There are 49 students in the class.

1. 1 student has not yet submitted their Project 1 proposal, which we are anxiously awaiting.
2. Proposals for 6 students are still under TA review and should be resolved tonight.
3. Proposals for 24 students have been reviewed by the TAs and are awaiting Dr. Love's review, which will happen as soon as he can get to them.
4. Proposals for 9 students received a score of 9 or lower in the initial TA review and need to revise and resubmit their work.
    - You'll find comments from the TA (mostly) on Canvas (and a grade below 10 points) on Canvas that indicates that you need to revise your work, which we hope will happen as soon as possible, and certainly within 48 hours of the Canvas posting. 
    - At least 2 students have already completed that revision, and Dr. Love and the TAs will start reviewing those as soon as all proposals have received their initial review and feedback on Canvas.
5. Proposals for 9 students have been reviewed and approved by a TA and then by Dr. Love. 
    - You'll find comments from us on Canvas (and a grade of 20) that indicates your proposal has been approved, and you should move on to completing the Project 1 portfolio of work.

You will know that your project 1 proposal is approved when you have a score of 20/20 on Canvas, and a note indicating we approve the proposal (or at least OK) usually with some additional feedback. 

Eventually, we will get everyone to position 5 on this list.
