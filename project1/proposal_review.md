# Project 1 Proposal Review Status

As of **9:15 AM 2021-03-05**

There are 49 students in the class. Only two groups are working in pairs, so there are 47 projects.

Stage | Students | Status
:----: | :------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4a | 1 | Proposal needs revision, and student is expected to submit Saturday.
4b | 5 | Proposal needs revision, and student has been notified via Canvas to complete before Mon 8 AM.
5 | 43 | Proposal is approved on Canvas (score is 20). Please review our comments and then go forth and build the Project.

- The scoring on Canvas ranges from 0-9 (number of completed elements out of 10) for those in Stage 4 and then jumps to 20 (for those in Stage 5) once the proposal is approved.
- You will know that your project 1 proposal is approved when you have a score of 20/20 on Canvas, and a note indicating we approve the proposal (or at least OK) usually with some additional feedback. 

Our goal is to get everyone to Stage 5 as quickly as we can.

- I expect to respond, via Canvas, to all revisions that we receive on Friday 2021-03-05 no later than 1 PM Eastern time on Saturday 2021-03-06.
- Additional revisions, if required after that review, will be due at 8 AM Monday 2021-03-08.

We certainly hope no one will need additional revisions after that time, but we'll see what happens.
