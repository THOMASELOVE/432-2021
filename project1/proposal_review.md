# Project 1 Proposal Review Status

There are 49 students in the class. Only two groups are working in pairs, so there are 47 projects.

Stage | Students | Status
:----: | :------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4 | 4 | Proposal still needs revision, and the details are on Canvas.
5 | 45 | Proposal is approved on Canvas (score is 20). Please review our comments and then go forth and build the Project.

- You will know that your project 1 proposal is approved when you have a score of 20/20 on Canvas, and a note indicating we approve the proposal (or at least OK) usually with some additional feedback.
