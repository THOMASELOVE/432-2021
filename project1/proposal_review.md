# Project 1 Proposal Review Status

As of **12:45 PM 2021-03-04**: 

There are 49 students in the class.

Stage | Students | Status
:----: | :------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 | 1 | Project 1 proposal not yet submitted. We await this anxiously.
2 | 0 | Proposal submitted. TAs will complete initial review tonight.
3 | 27 | Proposal reviewed by TAs as pretty solid, and awaits Dr. Love's decision and posting to Canvas.
4 | 10 | Proposal requires revision and resubmission and student has been notified via Canvas.
5 | 11 | Proposal is approved on Canvas (score is 20). Move on to build your portfolio.

- The scoring on Canvas ranges from 0-9 (number of completed elements out of 10) for those in Stage 4 and then jumps to 20 (for those in Stage 5) once the proposal is approved.
    - If you don't have a score yet on Canvas, your project is in Stages 1-3.
- Those of you requiring revisions are expected to do this as soon as possible, and certainly within 48 hours of our post to Canvas.
    - Some (at least 2) students have already completed that revision, and we'll start reviewing those as soon as everyone else has a reaction from us on Canvas.
- You will know that your project 1 proposal is approved when you have a score of 20/20 on Canvas, and a note indicating we approve the proposal (or at least OK) usually with some additional feedback. 

Subsequent revisions after the first one will be on a shorter timeline - please make a point of checking Canvas/email each day until you've been approved. Our goal is to get everyone to Stage 5 as quickly as we can.
