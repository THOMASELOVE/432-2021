# Project 1 Proposal Review Status

As of **7:30 PM 2021-03-05**

There are 49 students in the class. Only two groups are working in pairs, so there are 47 projects.

Stage | Students | Status
:----: | :------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4 | 4 | Proposal needs revision, and student has been notified via Canvas to complete by Monday at 8 AM.
5 | 45 | Proposal is approved on Canvas (score is 20). Please review our comments and then go forth and build the Project.

- The scoring on Canvas ranges from 0-9 (number of completed elements out of 10) for those in Stage 4 and then jumps to 20 (for those in Stage 5) once the proposal is approved.
- You will know that your project 1 proposal is approved when you have a score of 20/20 on Canvas, and a note indicating we approve the proposal (or at least OK) usually with some additional feedback. 

Our goal is to get everyone to Stage 5 as quickly as we can.
