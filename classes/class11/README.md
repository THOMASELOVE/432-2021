## Materials for Today's Class

- Today's Slides will be [available in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/classes/class11/432_2021_slides11.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/classes/class11/432_2021_slides11.Rmd).
- All 432 classes are video-recorded, and the recordings will be archived in the Zoom section of [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).

We'll continue talking about the `tidymodels` packages today. I'll remind you of some useful supplemental learning resources.

1. Max Kuhn and Julia Silge's book [Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/) which has been my main resource.
2. For videos with great `tidymodels` examples, try [Julie Silga's YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/c/JuliaSilge/videos). I highlighted a few specific videos in the [Class 10 README](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/classes/class10).
3. The [tidymodels website](https://www.tidymodels.org/), in particular the [Get Started](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/) tutorials, and the [Learn section](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/).

## Announcements

1. Dr. Love's [Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 10](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/minutepapers) will be posted by class time.
2. [Lab 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/labs/lab03/lab03_instructions.md) is due 2021-03-15 at 9 PM. Be sure to use the [current version of the instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/labs/lab03/lab03_instructions.md).
3. [Quiz A](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/quizzes/quizA) will be available by noon tomorrow, and is due 2021-03-22 at 9 PM.
    - The Quiz includes materials from the first 9 classes, from Chapters 1-14 of the course notes, from all of Jeff Leek's *How to be a modern scientist* and from Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* through Chapter 7. It does not include this week's `tidymodels` material.
    - The instructions for Quiz A [are already posted](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/quizzes/quizA).
4. Your [Project 1 Portfolio and Presentation](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/02_project1_analyses.md) are due 2021-03-29 at 9 PM. You should be able to complete this work now.
5. Remember that next Tuesday 2021-03-16 is a University Break day, and so we will not have class. Our next Class (Class 12) will be held on 2021-03-18.
6. If you're interested in another example of formulating a machine learning activity within the tidymodels framework (especially if you've previously worked with the `caret` package) you might enjoy [The simplest tidy machine learning workflow](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/02/the-simplest-tidy-machine-learning-workflow/) by Jorge Cimentada.
7. The next session in the CAUSE/Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education webinar series is 2021-03-23 at 4 PM. It features talks about two related papers on data ingestation, data collection, and data analysis. [Register or learn more here](https://psu.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_aTtp-SdYRwi3pLvPkMEGMQ).
8. I missed highlighting the sad passing last month of [Dr. Arianna Wright Rosenbluth](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/science/arianna-wright-dead.html), who was a critical figure in data science, and programmed the Metropolis algorithm that is a fundamental part of the way we do sampling these days in many contexts.

## One Last Thing

It's probably time to trot this out again, from [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/2048/)...
