## Materials for Today's Class

- Today's Slides will be [available in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/classes/class10/432_2021_slides10.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/classes/class10/432_2021_slides10.Rmd).
- All 432 classes are video-recorded, and the recordings will be archived in the Zoom section of [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).

Today we're introducing the `tidymodels` set of packages. Excellent resources for learning more include:

1. The [tidymodels website](https://www.tidymodels.org/), in particular the [Get Started](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/) tutorials, and the [Learn section](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/), which has additional information on performing analyses, tuning models, and developing custom approaches, among other things.
2. Max Kuhn and Julie Silge's book [Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/) which has been my main way to learn about these approaches.
3. For videos with great `tidymodels` examples, try [Julie Silge's YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/c/JuliaSilge/videos). I'll highlight...
    - [Model student debt inequality with tidymodels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ayOjlRv8bA) from 2021-02-12
    - [Get started with tidymodels and classification of penguin data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z57i2GVcdww) from 2020-07-28
    - [Predict astronauts' mission duration with tidymodels and bootstrap aggregation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzfTA3xi-W0) from 2020-07-15
    - [Data preprocessing and resampling using tidymodels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3TkvZM60iU) from 2020-03-10
    - [Get started with tidymodels using vaccination rate data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2Ld3QdXYZo) from 2020-02-25
4. You may be interested in Bruna Wundervald's [An introduction to the tidymodels package](http://brunaw.com/tidymodels-webinar/slides/slides.html#1) slides, too.

## Announcements

1. There is a Minute Paper after today's class (Class 10) due Wednesday 2021-03-10 at noon.
2. Lab 3 is due next Monday 2021-03-15 at 9 PM.
    - As mentioned on Piazza, on 2021-03-05, Dr. Love simplified [the instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/labs/lab03/lab03_instructions.md) slightly for the fourth part of question 1, and also added [four hints we hope will be helpful for question 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/labs/lab03/lab03_instructions.md#four-hints-for-question-1).


## One Last Thing

[Language for communicating frequentist results about treatment effects](https://discourse.datamethods.org/t/language-for-communicating-frequentist-results-about-treatment-effects/934) from the discourse page at datamethods.org is perhaps worth a little of your time.
