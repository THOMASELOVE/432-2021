Today we're talking about `tidymodels`. Excellent resources for learning more include:

1. The [tidymodels website](https://www.tidymodels.org/), in particular the [Get Started](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/) tutorials, and the [Learn section](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/), which has additional information on performing analyses, tuning models, and developing custom approaches, among other things.
2. Max Kuhn and Julie Silge's book [Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/) which has been my main way to learn about these approaches.
3. [Julie Silge's YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/c/JuliaSilge/videos) which includes lots of great videos using tidymodels methods. Five videos of special interest to me were ...
    - [Model student debt inequality with tidymodels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ayOjlRv8bA) from 2021-02-12
    - [Get started with tidymodels and classification of penguin data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z57i2GVcdww) from 2020-07-28
    - [Predict astronauts' mission duration with tidymodels and bootstrap aggregation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzfTA3xi-W0) from 2020-07-15
    - [Data preprocessing and resampling using tidymodels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3TkvZM60iU) from 2020-03-10
    - [Get started with tidymodels using vaccination rate data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2Ld3QdXYZo) from 2020-02-25

## Announcements
