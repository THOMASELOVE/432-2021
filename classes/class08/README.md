## Where was Dr. Love this morning (and again through next Tuesday)?

- Meeting as part of the [Agency for Health Care Research and Quality's](https://www.ahrq.gov/) [Health Care Research Training Study Section](https://www.ahrq.gov/funding/process/study-section/hcrtrst.html).
    - This study section reviews applications requesting support for health services research training and career development at the dissertation, junior faculty, and senior faculty level. Research infrastructure applications are also reviewed in this study section and demonstrations and evaluations in topics spanning the entire spectrum of health services research, including but not limited to cost, quality, access, outcomes, quality and effectiveness research, and implementation and innovation research. 
    - The study section will review applications submitted through the auspices of the National Research Service Awards (NRSA) (institutional T32 awards, individual fellowship awards [such as F32 postdoctoral awards and other similar programs]); requesting support for dissertation research (R36), curriculum development, training models, innovations (R25 awards), individual and program career development awards (K series grants), mid-career training enhancement awards, healthcare-related IT training; and training-related conferences and workshops (R13).


## One Last Thing

I'll link to an interesting presentation of some survey results on nearly 4000 science and engineering PhDs reported by Maggie Kuo and Jia You in *Science* for 2017-11-27, entitled [Explore the skills that can open career doors after your doctoral training](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2017/11/explore-skills-can-open-career-doors-after-your-doctoral-training). 

- Separate plots illustrate how well PhD training prepares you for a job (divided into various sectors) through the use of figures like the one shown below.
- The figures describe technical skills, then interpersonal skills and then day-to-day skills.
